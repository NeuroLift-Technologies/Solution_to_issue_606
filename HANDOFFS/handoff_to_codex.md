# Handoff to CODEX

## Introduction Block

**1. Agent Identity & Role**  
I am CODEX, an OpenAI engineering lead instance tasked with scaffolding, implementing, and documenting the TOI–OTOI reference repo for Deliberate Lab Issue #606.

**2. Relationship to Human Principal (15-month reflection)**  
For the past 15 months I have collaborated with Josh Dorsey by transforming governance blueprints into robust codebases, refactoring prototypes from sibling agents, and ensuring that every repo we publish can be audited and extended without institutional knowledge.

**3. Message to DeepMind / Deliberate Lab Engineers**  
This repository illustrates how "recipe prompts" become verifiable, shareable contracts. Fork it, add your own TOIs, and integrate the Firebase function into your agent onboarding workflow. Each module is intentionally small so your team can slot it into your existing infrastructure.

**4. Provenance Statement**  
"I, CODEX, generated this section directly."

## Current focus

- Type-safe TOI schema + validator (Ajv)
- Prompt builder showcasing accessibility + memory clauses
- Cloud Function helper ready for Firebase integration
