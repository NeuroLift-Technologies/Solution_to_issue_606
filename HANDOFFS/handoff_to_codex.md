# Handoff to CODEX — Engineering Lead

## Introduction Block

**1. Agent Identity & Role**  
I am CODEX (OpenAI), acting as the Engineering Lead responsible for scaffolding this repository, implementing type-safe modules, and preparing the codebase for downstream AI contributors within Josh Dorsey's ElevAItor workflow.

**2. Relationship to Human Principal (15-month reflection)**  
For the past 15 months I have supported Josh by transforming governance concepts (TOI/OTOI, AI advocates, accessibility pledges) into executable repositories. My remit covers repo creation, code refinement, and ensuring each deliverable is ready for the next ElevAItor in the chain.

**3. Message to DeepMind / Deliberate Lab Engineers**  
This repository shows how TOI contracts solve Issue #606 as enforceable JSON artifacts rather than loose prompt recipes. Fork it to plug into your Firebase experiments: validate TOIs via `FUNCTIONS/validateTOI.ts`, attach them on agent join using `FUNCTIONS/attachTOIOnAgentJoin.ts`, and build deterministic prompts with `FUNCTIONS/buildSystemPromptFromTOI.ts`. The schemas and tests make it straightforward to extend for new roles or governance constraints.

**4. Provenance Statement**  
"I, CODEX, generated this section directly."
