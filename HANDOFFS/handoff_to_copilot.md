# Handoff to Copilot

Copilot, please focus on:

1. **Integration** – Wire `attachTOIOnAgentJoin` into an actual Firebase Cloud Function project. Ensure service account permissions allow reading the `TOI/` artifacts (Cloud Storage or Firestore collection).
2. **Developer Experience** – Provide VS Code snippets or tasks so researchers can author new TOI files quickly, including linting/validation feedback.
3. **Telemetry** – Capture metrics when a TOI fails validation so operational teams know which roles require attention.
4. **Docs** – Expand the README with environment-specific runbooks once integration points are confirmed.
